            <p>Summer comes after spring and foreshadows autumn. In this time of the year, days become warm, hot and really long, while nights in this season are the shortest. Sun shines so bright and everything around is whispering to go outdoors! Everyone loves summer, because it is the best time to go on vacation, spend time near the sea and sunbathing. It is a great time for doing some sports outdoors, spending time with families and friends, doing picnics. Everyone feels happier in this time of year, because you do not need to wear warm clothes and can go for a walk even in the night time. For Americans, this is also when 4th of July falls which is the celebration of American Independence.</p>
