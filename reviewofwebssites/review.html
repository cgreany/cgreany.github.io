            <a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple Inc.</a>
            <p>Apple for years now has been a master piece of a website. When you vist the page you are immediately met with outsstand graphic and different J-script features. As your scroll around you will find a very useful navigation bar and search bar which makes about everything easy to find on the apple website. As you continue to look around you will find several different pages for each different product, each page detailed with different J-script annimations. Another cool aspect of the website is the look is slick and clean, their are very few bugs and flaws within the code which makes usisng the website satitisfying. Scatter around the page are several links to different Apple "subcompanies" or projects, such as iCloud and Apple Music. The code behind the able website is all up to date and include parts from HTMl 5. I would assume that more than likely the webssite is run by apple devs but uses some sort of content manager such as Drupal or other services.</p>
            <a href="https://www.cnn.com/">CNN</a>
            <p>My secound good website was Cnn.com which is a reliable news network. The website is in a 3-column format with the option to switch one column, which is not my favorite way to read news articles as it feels a little overwhelming. The website's navigation is quite similar; it is broken into specific categories, which makes it convenient if you want to focus on news that might impact the stock market. When you look at the code, you can see that the HTML file runs on HTML 5, as it includes elements such as div, script, style, and many more. One of the little things about the CNN website I like is that website provides quick links to current events; for example, there is a quick link to COVID news amd the Ukraine/Russia Conflict. The website, when fully expanded, has borders that keep everything centered on the page. The website is mobile-friendly and does not squish the material. Overall, a few things about that website I do not like, the clusters of information, but the pro outweighs these nitpick things.</p>
            <a href="https://www.craiglist.com">Craiglist</a>
            <p>My final website is quite horrific which is Craiglist. Which is a column website and has several different columns. The site appearss to have no-very little css, which is only used for alignment and other aspects. The is not color or theme to the website and its seems quite bland. Their are several links when you firsst open the page but thye are just states you really lack what the purpose of the websites is. Throughout the page it switches from single column to two and even three columns. The page is acticely using HTML 5 which is expect as the page is used by alot of people to sell and buy things. I personally believe that the software engineers at craigslist purposely designed the website to look bland and empty. </p>
