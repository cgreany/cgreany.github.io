    <h1><a href="https://www.nebraska.gov/">Favorite State Website</a></h1>
    <p>Nebraska's State website is super clean and easy to navigate. It has a couple of quick links avaliable to its visitors. Additionally, the website features easy to use icons and links. Nebraska also has a very nice and bright color section that helps the background color(white) mesh all together. Lastly, the website includes a public calendar which is nice.</p>
    <h1><a href="https://www.illinois.gov/">Second Favorite Website</a></h1>
    <p>Illinois had a very slick website, and almost took first place. The website featured a navigation bar and a search bar. Though I didn't like the a couple of things about the website. For starters the color scheme seemed strange. Additionally, some of the text fonts were just not clean. This doesn't change the fact the page is super easy to navigate.</p>
    <h1><a href="https://delaware.gov/">Third Favorite State Website</a></h1>
    <p>While Deleware has an easy website to navigate, the color and text choices were not the best. I thought it was neat and useful that they included a state jobs search. This could potentially be very useful.</p>
    <h1><a href="https://www.myflorida.com/">Honorable Mention</a></h1>
    <p>While Floridas page looks nice and is easy to navigate, it lacks useful information. The page had no drop down navigation bar, but was very easy to navigate. The website included a useful link to the State of Florida directory and State Agencies, which proved much more useful than the state of florida home page.</p>
    <h1><a href="https://alaska.gov/">Least Favorite</a></h1>
    <p>Alaska's State website looks out dated and needs a bit of maintenance and work to look more professional. The page does includes a navigation bar, which was nice to see. The color choices and design layout were my least favorite of all 5 websites. Though the page did have a lot of information, such as the status of the state and national flags. The page just seemed crammed and busy, which messed up the website flow.</p>
